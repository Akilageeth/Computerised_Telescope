# Computerised_Telescope

The aim of this project would be to find some way to use landscape photography to monitor an ALT/AZ mounted telescope/camera.
It ought to be a simple matter of automatically monitoring the object by using a PC-based software (written in Visual Basic 2010) that can provide the current RA/DEC values for any celestial object. To keep the object monitored, the PC may send phase pulses to the telescope mount (after a few minutes of manual tracking for calibration).
I have chosen to design my own after spending months looking for a similar setup without success. The key benefits of this scheme are that the "Polar Align" spectrum is not necessary. The opportunity to aim the scope out of an open window when indoors in the warm with access to electricity and facilities are other advantages.
No chilly nights or dew settling on the lens any more.
You can take snapshots/videos of the object by inserting a camera into the eyepiece and using capture tools. By using Registax software to supply some nice pictures, these can be improved.
